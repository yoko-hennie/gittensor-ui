        answer={
          <>
            A subnet specific asset that is created within the Bittensor
            blockchain. New tokens are minted/distributed daily. It has a
            fluctuating price based on a subnet's liquidity pool. They also may
            provide utility value to the incentive mechanism or other aspects of
            a subnet. Check Gittensor's token page on{' '}

      <FAQ
        question="What is Gittensor?"
        answer="Gittensor is subnet 74 within the Bittensor network that rewards open source software developers for their contributions. It distributes emissions, in the form of alpha tokens, to developers whose code has been integrated and merged into recognized GitHub repositories."

      <FAQ
        question="How do I start mining on Gittensor?"
        answer={
          <>
            To start mining, you need to make pull requests to recognized OSS
            repositories on GitHub. Once your code is merged into the production
            branch, you'll be eligible for emissions based on factors like PR
            size, files affected, repository popularity, and more. Check out our
            GitHub repository for detailed setup instructions. Feel free to join

      <FAQ
        question="How are rewards calculated?"
        answer={
          <>
            Your rewards are determined by the weight of the repository you
            contribute to, the quality of your code changes (measured by
            token-based scoring), and multipliers like time decay, review
            quality, and issue bonuses. We also factor in your 'credibility',
            which is the ratio of your merged PRs to your total PR attempts
            (merged + closed). See the{' '}

      <FAQ
        question="Do I need to stake TAO to become a miner?"
        answer={
          <>
            No, miners do not need to stake TAO to participate. However,
            registering a miner UID on the subnet requires a registration fee
            (burn) in TAO, which fluctuates based on network demand. See the{' '}
